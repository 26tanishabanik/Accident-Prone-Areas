Signs of ‘tyre burst’, a common factor triggering road accidents, were not found. There was no evidence to suggest mechanical failure.\\n\\nAll these findings in an internal inquiry by Transport department suggest the Kondagattu bus tragedy that snuffed out 64 lives was the consequence of human error. Close to a year since the worst-ever road accident in the two Telugu States, police are yet to file a charge-sheet.\\n\\nReconstructing the accident, a team of experts engaged by higher-ups found that the hand brake of the bus was not used. The accident investigation specialists opened the steering system, the clutch and the brake pedals of the vehicle. There were no signs of any physical damage on them.\\n\\nThe gear rod, too, was in good condition. This was the main reason for them to deduce there was no mechanical failure. Even air pressure in all the bus tyres was normal. The point from where the 51-seater bus, overloaded with 104 passengers, plunged into the gorge was nearly at the end of the ghat road. That point had a sharp curve. Driver Srinivas, who was among the 64 killed, was familiar with Kondagattu ghat road and had driven the bus up and down the road several times.\\n\\nThe road had a steep slope for nearly 180 metres. The fateful day of September 11, 2018 was sunny and since the accident occurred around noon, the road was clearly visible. “When the bus started down the nearly 180-metre steep slope stretch, it had no technical issues. Even if there was some problem, the driver could have slammed the brakes,” a senior police officer associated with the investigation of the case and unwilling to be named observed.\\n\\nOverloading of a vehicle affects the capability of the brake pads and the driver needs to use more strength to apply the brakes in such situation. Experts took out the bus front wheels and noted that all the brake pads were intact. There were no traces of evidence to surmise that brakes were applied.\\n\\nBased on the inputs and scientific analysis of the experts, the investigators believe that the driver could not manoeuvre the bus properly at the end of the steep slope which had a sharp curve. When a vehicle is overloaded (in this case, the load was double the bus capacity), more pressure is exerted on the tyres.\\n\\nEven the weight on the axle and suspension of the vehicle goes up requiring the driver to use more strength to steer the vehicle. “Apparently, the driver could not swerve the steering wheel enough to turn left,” the officer noted.', 'All these findings in an internal inquiry by Transport department suggest the Kondagattu bus tragedy that snuffed out 64 lives was the consequence of human error.\\nClose to a year since the worst-ever road accident in the two Telugu States, police are yet to file a charge-sheet.\\nReconstructing the accident, a team of experts engaged by higher-ups found that the hand brake of the bus was not used.\\nDriver Srinivas, who was among the 64 killed, was familiar with Kondagattu ghat road and had driven the bus up and down the road several times.\\n“When the bus started down the nearly 180-metre steep slope stretch, it had no technical issues.']\n",

Hemanth called Satish to come home to discuss problematic issues. When the topic of discussion turned to vacating the house and the affair, Hemanth attacked Satish on the head with a hammer and then smothered him to death,” the DCP said.A car hired by Hemanth was brought to his house around 11.30pm. “Hemanth tried to shift the body into the vehicle, but could not as the victim was heavy. His plan was to create a road accident scene. Hemanth then took out Satish’s bike and parked it near their office.

This would give the family the much-needed relief as they would now, hopefully, get ten times more compensation than the one granted by the trial court and also, interest for the last 15 years.On October 10, 2004, B Krishnaiah was coming to Hyderabad from Mahabubnagar on a motorbike along with his friend. When they reached Kundurg village, a jeep came in high speed and hit their motorbike. Krishnaiah suffered severe injuries. He was shifted to Osmania General Hospital in Hyderabad where he succumbed to the injuries while undergoing treatment. His wife and three children were rendered helpless on account of the ghastly accident which took away their sole breadwinner. They sought Rs 15 lakh as compensation for the loss.The trial court in its judgment gave reasoning that Krishnaiah was a pillion rider on that fateful day. The man who drove the bike was not examined at all. The trial court concluded that the bike rider had possessed no valid driving license. Hence the drivers of both the jeep and the bike should bear the blame in equal measure. Hence the insurance company’s liability to compensate for the death of an individual was reduced to 50 percent. The trial court finally ordered the insurance company to pay Rs 1.78 lakh to the kin of the deceased.Aggrieved by this order, the wife and kin of the victim filed an appeal in the high court challenging the trial court order. Their counsel B Roja Ramani described the order of the trial court, particularly in holding the deceased as partly responsible for his death, as erroneous and bad in law. Merely because the driver of the bike was not holding a driving license, he cannot be held liable for contributory negligence, she said. The trial court committed another error even in calculating the number of dependents. The number of dependents is four and the trial court based its calculations on three dependents, she said.Setting aside the trial court order, Justice Amarnath cited a Supreme Court order that held that a scooter rider cannot be held guilty of contributory negligence merely because he was not possessing a driving license. He also calculated and arrived at Rs 17.74 lakh compensation to be paid to the family taking into various aspects like future prospects, the appropriate multiplier, the age of the deceased at the time of his death, loss to the dependents, etc.', 'His wife and three children were rendered helpless on account of the ghastly accident which took away their sole breadwinner.\\nThey sought Rs 15 lakh as compensation for the loss.The trial court in its judgment gave reasoning that Krishnaiah was a pillion rider on that fateful day.\\nThe trial court concluded that the bike rider had possessed no valid driving license.\\nTheir counsel B Roja Ramani described the order of the trial court, particularly in holding the deceased as partly responsible for his death, as erroneous and bad in law.\\nThe trial court committed another error even in calculating the number of dependents.']\n",

Around 7,000 accident records, mostly from Rachakonda commissionerate, from 2016 to 2018 were geo-coded by the research team at IIT-H to test the web-interface and the mobile application.“The system is believed to reduce the efforts put in by the traffic police to maintain and analyse the road accident record. The ADMS is developed using R programming which supports the data analysis, statistical computing with graphics support,” said Digvijay Pawar.As part of the web-interface system, the researchers have developed a road accident recording form wherein police or those witnessing the accident can upload details such as accident type, number of fatalities, number of persons grievously injured, persons with minor injuries, property damaged, number of motorized vehicles and pedestrians involved among others.According to the team of researchers at IIT-H, due to poor accident database, stakeholders are unable to find the exact cause of the accident and therefore temporary measures are taken by the field engineers and police officers to tackle accidents.For this, the research team has developed a mobile application which will help in collecting accident data. “The application can be used by both the police officers involved in road accident reporting and the road users. Separate login interface is provided for police and road users. Road users can report the accident by uploading photograph or by recording the video,” said Pawar.The data recorded in the web-based interface and the mobile application will also help the police identify accident hot spots for two-wheelers as well as for pedestrians.

            "['Jul 9, 2019', {'Delhi', 'Kolkata', 'June', 'Bengaluru', 'Hyderabad', 'India', 'Independence', 'Mumbai', 'Chennai'}, 'Animal Bloodline, started by Hyderabad-based electrical engineer Shiva Kumar Varma, is an NGO that aims to save the lives of animals that need blood transfusions by providing a nationwide list of animals registered as blood donors.\\n\\nAnd what is even better is that the NGO provides this service for free.\\n\\nTo know how Shiva came up with this extraordinary idea, we need to delve into his childhood.\\n\\nThe young Shiva had the habit of rescuing injured animals he found on the streets and taking them to a veterinary hospital. Once treated, he would drop the animals near the same place he picked them up from.\\n\\nOne such incident where he rescued a severely injured dog changed things for Shiva.\\n\\n“The dog had been in a road accident and needed more than 30-35 stitches,” he recalls. “The operation was successful but because of heavy bleeding, and our inability to find blood, the dog expired after two days.”\\n\\nThis incident affected him so much that he started researching about potential animal blood donors and where such services are provided. “To my surprise, I found out that 99.9 per cent of pet parents don’t even know their pet’s blood group,” he shares.\\n\\nDid you know that cats have blood groups A, B, and AB while dogs have more than seven blood groups like DEA 1.1, 1.2, 1.3 and DEA 4 (the universal donor)? According to their website, dogs can donate blood every three months and cats can donate four times a year.\\n\\nShiva had always been an active animal welfare activist and used to get around 20 calls a year from pet parents asking about blood donation for animals.\\n\\n“There are hardly one or two animal blood banks in the country. Imagine a situation where there are no blood banks!” he says. Shiva travelled across the country talking to pet owners, activists, and doctors to understand the situation. Wherever he visited – Mumbai, Delhi, Chennai, or Kolkata, he found that there was a complete lack of awareness about animals as blood donors. In fact, people were unaware that animals could donate blood or required transfusions.\\n\\nVets in cities with no blood banks told him that there was no hope even if some injured animals could be saved, because there was no way to procure the blood required.\\n\\nAdditionally, the only donor-lists he could find were informal ones that were circulated on WhatsApp groups of animal welfare activists in different cities.\\n\\nThis led to a brainwave – why not have a website with a list of animal donors across the country?\\n\\nPicture for representation only. Source: Unsplash\\n\\nAnd thus, Animal Bloodline was born on World Blood Donor Day, 14 June 2019, with the purpose of collecting details of animal blood donors across India.\\n\\nHow does their website work?\\n\\nPet parents register their name and contact details along with their pet’s name, blood group and other details. Once they register, they will appear in the donors’ list of that particular city. If your pet requires a blood transfusion, head to their website – you will find the contact details of a list of donors that you can reach out to.\\n\\nThe website also includes some helpful features – for example, once a pet has donated blood, their details will be hidden for three months. Additionally, once dogs reach the age of eight, the website hides their details because they cannot donate blood anymore.\\n\\nAnimal Bloodline provides a bridge between the donor animals and animals in need of blood. But their biggest challenge is to reach every pet owner and veterinary doctor across the country to spread awareness — animal lives will only be saved if the number of donor registrations increases.\\n\\n“In India, during medical emergencies, people don’t know where to go, who to approach, and how to find blood for their pets,” Shiva informs us. He added that even in cities where there are animal blood banks, the doctors are only able to save 20-30 per cent of pet lives.\\n\\nShiva is starting off by targeting metro cities like Delhi, Mumbai, Bengaluru, Kolkata, Chennai, and Hyderabad, to spread awareness amongst pet parents and veterinary doctors. They will then move on to smaller areas across India.\\n\\nAnimal bloodline is not involved with medical assessment but they help bridge the gap between blood donors and animals in need.\\n\\nIf you’re a pet parent, go ahead and register on Animal Bloodline. Time is critical in an emergency. Donating blood will cause no harm to your pet and you could be instrumental in saving many furry lives.\\n\\n(Edited by Saiqua Sultan)\\n\\nLike this story?

Unfortunately, these 5,627 kilometres of National Highways fit the cliche, ‘Highway to Hell’, perfectly well, owing to the number of accidents and deaths they have been witnessing over the years.\\n\\nThe years 2016 to 2018 saw a marginal decrease in road accidents along highways in State; the death rate, however, continued to remain high during this period. While the percentage of road accidents decreased by 1.5 per cent in 2016-2017, the same of road accident fatalities increased by 9.73 per cent. Meanwhile, the Department of Traffic and Road Safety (DTRS), that exclusively deals with matters relating to road safety, has proposed to set up new police stations on highways to prevent road accidents. It is yet to be seen how far these measures would go to keep the highways safe.\\n\\nAdilabad\\n\\nThe National Highway 44, that stretches from Nirmal to the border of Painganga River, connects the northern and southern ends of Adilabad district. Unfortunately, poor lighting is a major concern along this highway. There is a serious dearth of approach roads too, which puts lives of many people residing in nearby villages at risk as they use the road on a daily basis. In fact, Bhattisavargam village, which is located just a few kilometres from the highway, has developed its own approach road using gravel.\\n\\nWarangal\\n\\nThe National Highway 163 between Warangal and Hyderabad, is as prone to accidents as any other rocky road. As over 70 percent of the National Highway is a single lane, accidents are quite common here. In addition to this, the ongoing works to convert NH-163 into a four-lane highway has added to the woes of commuters, as it has reduced the width of the road. As per police records, in 2018 about 82 accidents occurred on NH 163 involving trucks, especially those carrying sand. Following the rise in number of accidents, the Bhupalpally and Mulugu police have begun regulating them by imposing a speed limit. Over 1,500 trucks carry sand to Kaleshwaram project sites on a daily basis through the NH.\\n\\nNizamabad\\n\\nNational Highway 44 passing through the erstwhile Nizamabad covers more than 150 km within the district. Police officials opine that accidents mostly occur at places where approach roads meet the National Highway. This was also observed by police patrolling units in all areas along the highway. Around 1000 km of the NH 63 from Nizamabad to Jagadalpur also passes through the district. Some parts of the road are under construction, slowing down traffic movement in addition to increasing risks of accidents.\\n\\nNalgonda\\n\\nThere is only one national highway that passes though erstwhile Nalgonda district. It runs between Hyderabad and Vijayawada. Thousands of people use it everyday, as it an arterial road that connects the two Telugu sibling States. Accidents are common place. Heavy vehicles, parked haphazardly on the side of the roads, make the life of motorists miserable. At toll plazas, the National Highways Authority of India (NHAI) has set up separate parking spots for them, but truck drivers rarely use them\\n\\nKhammam\\n\\nThe stretch of national highways from Ibrahimpatnam to Bhadrachalam, and from Suryapet to Aswaraopet, have become death traps. Heavy vehicles transporting coal from open cast mines of Kistram village to Kothagudem are a serious cause for concern. More than 200 people were killed in road accidents on the road to Aswaraopet, which leads into the neighbouring State of Andhra Pradesh. Signs asking motorists to stick to speed limits are set up, however people rarely pay attention to them.\\n\\nSangareddy\\n\\nPeople of the State are wary of travelling on NH65, Akola-Nanded highway and the Hyderabad-Gajwel-Siddipet stretch of the Rajiv Rahadari highway.

That being said, it is important to note that around 300 people die and 2,000 get injured every year in road accidents in erstwhile Mahbubnagar district. This has been confirmed by official sources.\\n\\nThere have been numerous cases of toll plaza mishaps that occur when driver suddenly change the lanes. This points towards the urgent need for the setting up of an effective toll plaza management system by the government.The State government has, in fact, constituted a Cabinet sub-committee to sort the issue out. The panel had announced it would prepare a detailed action plan to prevent accidents. But the report has not seen the light of day as of yet. Further, the NH44 has a black spot for every 1.5 km from Balanagar to Alampur Cross Roads.\\n\\nThe officials concerned have also failed to install speed guns along the highway to prevent vehicles from overspeeding.

There are a number of factors responsible for the increase in mortality rate among two-wheeler riders involved in road accidents. There is an urgent need for a thorough scientific study of all the factors involved, including bad road conditions and over-speeding. The helmet rule should be implemented strictly as also the 'penalty points system' introduced by police earlier this year. TIMES VIEW:\\n\\nHYDERABAD: Call it alarming if you will, but increasingly a higher number of young two-wheeler riders in Hyderabad are involved in road mishaps, with a high percentage of disability and mortality. In fact, the average age of road accident victims in the city is 32.4 years, reveals an international research study. Interestingly, the mishap rate is higher among young men than women in the city. Six out of 10 road accidents (60%) involve two-wheeler riders and two out of 10 pedestrians (20%).Auto rickshaws account for about 10% of all road mishaps while the rest are accounted for by four-wheelers. Incidentally, only onethird of two-wheeler riders wear helmets and this perhaps explains the high mortality rate among this group. Over-speeding is also a major contributory factor for mishaps involving two-wheeler riders.A joint team of researchers from Johns Hopkins International Injury Research Unit, Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health , USA, Indian Institute of Public Health, Hyderabad, Department of Epidemiology, World Health Organisation, and Collaborating Centre for Injury Prevention and Safety Promotion, Bangalore, conducted a study of road traffic victims receiving medical treatment.The study was published in the recent issue of the Journal of Surgery. As many as 5,298 road traffic victims in the city were part of the study, which found that while the average age of road injury patients was 32.4 years, nearly 87.3% of the victims were men. The study also revealed that 58.2% of patients were injured while riding a motorcycle or scooter, 22.5% while walking, and 9.2% while riding auto rickshaws.“The most frequent collision type was skid or rollover (40.9%). Male victims were younger than female victims and were over-represented among motorized two-wheeler users. Patients were most frequently injured from 4.00pm to midnight. A total of 27.3% of patients were admitted. Hospital mortality was 5.3% and 48.2% of deaths were among motorized two-wheeler users,” the research study revealed.The researchers pointed out that when compared to government surveillance systems, their study showed motorized two-wheeler users to be more frequently represented among the overall population and among fatalities. They suggested further research to develop interventions to decrease mortality associated with two-wheelers.In a separate study published in the recent issue of the Journal of Public Health, the same group of researchers, besides those from the Indian Institute of Technology, Kharagpur, interviewed about 5,000 two-wheeler riders. Only 34.5% of the twowheeler riders said they follow the helmet rule and of these only 44.5% said they always wore a helmet.“Male gender, youth (below 24 years), a lower level of education and non-ownership of helmet were associated with a higher risk of not wearing helmets. Male gender, youth, no schooling, riding a lower engine capacity motorcycle and using a motorcycle for purposes other than travelling to school/ work were associated with over-reporting of helmet use,” the researchers said.Meanwhile, an analysis of the data of road accidents in Hyderabad and other parts of Telangana reveals that the fatality rate in case of two-wheeler accidents has increased in last two years.This experts attribute to an increase in the number of higher CC engine bikes on the roads, over-speeding, non-compliance of helmet rule, bad road conditions, triple riding and flouting of traffic rules, particularly at busy junctions.\", \"Of late, there has been a spurt in fatalities involving two-wheeler riders in Hyderabad and other parts of Telangana.\\nThere are a number of factors responsible for the increase in mortality rate among two-wheeler riders involved in road accidents.\\nThe helmet rule should be implemented strictly as also the 'penalty points system' introduced by police earlier this year.\\nIn fact, the average age of road accident victims in the city is 32.4 years, reveals an international research study.\\nIncidentally, only onethird of two-wheeler riders wear helmets and this perhaps explains the high mortality rate among this group.\"]\n",

Apart from these arterial roads, the SCB maintains about 300 small roads and streets.Ironically, portions of roads falling under the purview of the defence ministry are maintained well. In fact, they are black topped periodically .But the roads under the purview of the SCB are badly maintained.Among the reasons for this neglect is the fight between the Local Military Authority (LMA) and the Secunderabad Cantonment Board, which has led to a delay in repairs of important roads and junctions. Encroachments and location of religious places have also affected the SCB's plans to widen roads.In an example of a tricky situation, to widen the Bowenpally Crossroads, about three square yards of land belonging to a graveyard is needed.But the SCB could not convince the management committee of the graveyard.As a result, the road has become narrow leading to frequent mishaps. Another major bottleneck is a graveyard near to Tadbund Crossroads. In 2016, at least five deaths occurred on this stretch.These road accidents were related to congestion. The Tabdund Crossroads comes under National Highway Authority of India (NHAI). Though modifications like increasing the height of the road median have been done, it has not solved the problem. On the other side, a piece of land is required for widening, but defence authorities are not willing to part with land, it is alleged.The LIC Junction is another accident prone area in Tri mulgherry. Here, a TSSPDCL 's 133 KV tower, occupying a fourth of the area, has become a bottleneck. “Though accidents occur, there is no efforts to widen the road. Luckily , there have been no casualties. But cases of vehicles hitting one another are reported frequently.About 60sqft LIC land is required for widening the junction. A panel from LIC head office inspected the site and responded positively ,“ Inspector, Traffic, Trimulgherry, R Rajeswara Rao, told TOI. To widen the road, the SCB needs to acquire defence land at Hanuman Temple.A narrow stretch at Military Hospital junction has the most number of accidents in Secunderabad Cantt.Thousands of vehicles coming from AS Rao Nagar, Safilguda, Neredmet, Malkajgiri and adjoining areas pass through this stretch.The existing road has a width of 30feet.Poor street lighting, lack of road dividers and congestion result in accidents. Every year, four to five persons die here.“We are corresponding with SCB authorities. We have sought widening of the road and proper lighting and signage. But there has been no response,“ said Station House Officer, Trimulgherry, R Satyanarayana Raju.\", 'Apart from these arterial roads, the SCB maintains about 300 small roads and streets.Ironically, portions of roads falling under the purview of the defence ministry are maintained well.\\nIn 2016, at least five deaths occurred on this stretch.These road accidents were related to congestion.\\nThough modifications like increasing the height of the road median have been done, it has not solved the problem.\\nBut cases of vehicles hitting one another are reported frequently.About 60sqft LIC land is required for widening the junction.\\nA panel from LIC head office inspected the site and responded positively ,“ Inspector, Traffic, Trimulgherry, R Rajeswara Rao, told TOI.']\n",

The mortality rate is as high as 48.2%. They studied as many as 5,298 road acci dent victims.

This is fuelling the thrill for speed among violators. When on highways, most motorists tend to test the speed limits of their expensive cars.“Young buyers are often eager to test the upper speed limits of their cars. Since city roads are full of obstacles, they usually take them to the highways for such activity. But while the vehicles might be capable of going up to 400 kmph speed, the drivers aren’t sufficiently equipped to handle such high speeds. If there is a blind spot, sudden turning or wrong alignment either at a turn or after a break in the median, these drivers lose control, leading to accidents,” said a manager of a high-end car showroom.Traffic police (Cyberabad) reveal how vehicles often go at 240 kmph along the ORR and other broad roads in the city. Many high-end luxury cars even go up to 250-300 kmph.Road engineering defects also add to the severity of accidents, say experts. They estimated that at least 60% of the cases reported would have seen much less impact had engineering defects not existed. Records show there are 342 killer black spots in the state, which have resulted in 2,154 accidents and 1,114 deaths. “Of the total fatalities in road accidents in the state, 15% were recorded at these black spots. ,” said T Krishna Prasad, DG road safety.Driving with high beam that has a blinding effect on other drivers and drink driving are among the other key reasons. “Nearly 80-85% of accidents happen due to human errors. When speeding or drink driving combine with road engineering defects or high beams, the result is disastrous,” said Vinod Kumar Kanumala, road safety expert and founder Indian Federation of Road Safety.', 'When on highways, most motorists tend to test the speed limits of their expensive cars.“Young buyers are often eager to test the upper speed limits of their cars.\\nSince city roads are full of obstacles, they usually take them to the highways for such activity.\\nMany high-end luxury cars even go up to 250-300 kmph.Road engineering defects also add to the severity of accidents, say experts.\\nRecords show there are 342 killer black spots in the state, which have resulted in 2,154 accidents and 1,114 deaths.\\n“Of the total fatalities in road accidents in the state, 15% were recorded at these black spots.']\n",

A separate mechanism should have been brought into existance by now if any of the transport authorities, the higher officials, paid proper heed to the call of the laws and courts, legal observors say.When a PIL was filed challenging the inaction of the authorities after the Diwakar Travels Bus accident at Vijayawada, the HC bench headed by none other than Chief Justice himself ordered the two states to come out with their clear action plans explaining the steps they are taking to implement the laws in this regard.Whether the state and transport wing were ensuring the two driver norm for long distance private vehicles?

In a surprising revelation, it turns out that slow-moving tractors account for maximum road accident fatalities much more than trucks , cars, autos and two-wheelers.A recent study by State Road Safety Authority and Transport Department revealed as many as 43 people died for every 100 accidents involving tractors compared to 42 fatalities involving trucks. On an average, 43 people died for every 100 accidents when tractors were involved during the last three years on roads in Telangana.In comparison, severity rate (deaths per100 accidents) was 30 when two-wheelers (bikes) were involved in accidents, 30 casualties in case of buses, 26 in case of cars and other light motor vehicles and 24 in case of autos.Traffic and transport safety experts said high death rate in tractor-accidents is because tractors are not designed to carry passengers and even a small jerk causes head injuries.“Farmers carry passengers in trailers attached to tractors in violation of rules. Trailers designed to carry agricultural produce. Passengers do not have seating facility nor grip even in a minor accident. Agricultural labourers, construction workers and families going to marriage parties are transported dangerously in these trailers,“ said Indian Federation of Road Safety Chief Functionary , Vinod Kumar Kanumala.Also, another major reason for tractors turning into killer vehicles is their slow movement and poor visibility .“As tractors work in agricultural fields, radium-strapped reflectors and tail lights and indicators get covered with dust and mud and are not visible from a distance for motorists coming at a high speed,“ said Vinod Kumar Kanumala.Engineering Staff College of India former director-gener al S Nagabhushan Rao blamed high tractor-related road fatalities on lack of enforcement by transport officials to book cases against farmers who transport passengers in trailers, lack of special training to drive tractors before issuing driving licence. Currently , heavy vehicle driving licence is sufficient to drive a tractor, which is inadequate, he said.Joint Transport Commissioner T Raghunath said lack of staff leads to inefficient enforcement. “There are no service roads and tractors take to the highways, be it state or a national highway , to go back to their village from the field. Often, they go on the wrong side too.Our officers cannot be there at every village to check these violations,“ he said.\", \"HYDERABAD: It's not always that speed kills , especially when it comes to driving.\\nPassengers do not have seating facility nor grip even in a minor accident.\\nCurrently , heavy vehicle driving licence is sufficient to drive a tractor, which is inadequate, he said.Joint Transport Commissioner T Raghunath said lack of staff leads to inefficient enforcement.\\n“There are no service roads and tractors take to the highways, be it state or a national highway , to go back to their village from the field.\\nOften, they go on the wrong side too.Our officers cannot be there at every village to check these violations,“ he said.\"]\n",

For instance, villagers of Kollur were found to be using an illegal ramp to access ORR while going towards Velumala.Also, drivers were found to be at fault for not giving proper signals in case of a vehicle breakdown. In such cases, drivers need to take precautions like switching on parking lights to warn others.

Essentially a pedestrian-friendly measure, these have become a nuisance because they are not built or installed according to guidelines and the choice of spots is arbitrary. Infamously known for being back breakers and in some instances even lead to fatal accidents.\\n\\nAs per the Indian Road Congress (IRC) guidelines, dated June 12 1987 (and which are relevant even today), speed breakers are supposed to be erected on minor roads which intersect with major roads, and mid-block sections in urban areas where there is a tendency of accidents due to speeding, and also near hospitals and schools.\\n\\nThe IRC has suggested that speed breakers must have 17 metres radius with a hump of 3.7 metre width and 0.10 metre height. The hump should be in negotiation with 25 kmph speed of the vehicle.\\n\\nThese bone breakers add to the traffic hassle too. Commenting on the same, AV Ranganath, DCP Traffic says that unauthorised speed breakers are sure of a havoc to the riders. “Lot of colonies build their own speed breakers which are illegal and also lack scientific elements that go into a speed breaker. In addition to that, they are not painted too sometimes. We have received a lot of complaints from the people on how those speed breakers at unwanted places like alley turnings and road joints are creating hurdles in their ride.”\\n\\nHe goes on to add, “Usually when the civic bodies construct the breakers, they keep in mind the scientific norms of a speed breaker. The authorities take a call on the erection of a breaker after a thorough inspection of the road and also the connecting roads. The idea of puttingup a hump is to slow down the pace of the vehicle and not to break the vehicle itself. The unauthorised breakers are not just endangering the safety of the vehicle and rider, it is also doubling the pain of bumpy roads,” he informed.\\n\\nAll a rider demands is enough gap between speed breakers and above all a signboard or painting on the speed breakers. “In Bhale Bhale Mogadivoyi, a recent Telugu flick had a scene where the doctor applauds the hero for saving the pregnant woman and help her have a normal delivery of the child although she was supposed to undergo a Cesarean section. The protagonist is surprised about his contribution and recalls about the speed breaker on the way that helped the child to turn in the right direction. That scene actually reflects the real scenario of the roads in the city especially where illegal speed breakers are replete in areas like Maredpally, OU campus, Madhura Nagar, Kukatpally, Cantonment, Yosufguda and many more to name are very dangerous,” Nimmalguda Prabhakar, a bank employee, says.\\n\\nSuresh Raju, founder of Vaada Foundation, a NGO that works for the safety of people on roads firmly advised that GHMC should inspect speed breakers at regular intervals and take immediate action against illegal humps. “It is the responsibility of the commuters to report to the police, when there is an illegal hump. If a colony or a road needs a speed breaker, they should thorough the procedure by taking permission of GHMC and Traffic Police. It is the responsibility of GHMC to construct and not anyone else,” he informed.\\n\\n“To save lives, time, wear and tear and also fuel, the officials should consider plastic speed breakers in place of the concrete cement ones. The plastic humps which are in bright yellow and black colours are visible, safe and easy. Though they are expensive, they make the lives of people easy and serve the purpose too,” he informs.', 'The IRC has suggested that speed breakers must have 17 metres radius with a hump of 3.7 metre width and 0.10 metre height.\\nCommenting on the same, AV Ranganath, DCP Traffic says that unauthorised speed breakers are sure of a havoc to the riders.\\n“Lot of colonies build their own speed breakers which are illegal and also lack scientific elements that go into a speed breaker.\\nAll a rider demands is enough gap between speed breakers and above all a signboard or painting on the speed breakers.\\n“To save lives, time, wear and tear and also fuel, the officials should consider plastic speed breakers in place of the concrete cement ones.']\n",

Murthy.\\n\\nThe number of elevator accidents in high-rise buildings is rising in Hyderabad and elsewhere. The recent death of a nursery student in Dilsukhnagar in a lift accident is a case in point. To prevent such accidents, which are entirely avoidable, it is imperative for authorities in the State government to start giving serious thought to having regulatory framework for lift operations.\\n\\nMost of the accidents that are related to lifts usually occur on grill gate lifts (only a few months back, BJP’s Amit Shah was trapped in a lift for 40 minutes) wherein, for the purpose of saving money, construction agencies and builders prefer to equip their lift car and landings with grills. Ironically, when compared to other States, such lifts are more common in Andhra Pradesh and Telangana State.\\n\\nIn such circumstances, it is very important for the authorities to start exploring the possibility of creating a Lift Act, based on which, the entire sector can be regulated. Most of the States have a separate government authority to ensure safety operation of the lifts and the safety of the users.\\n\\nWhen it comes to adopting a Lift Act for Telangana State, one need not look far! There are a large number of stringent strictures that have been laid out clearly for the benefit of lift users in the Bombay Lift Act of 1939, which is being implemented successfully in Maharashtra.\\n\\nEssentially, the Lift Act should be brought under the purview of Chief Engineer (Electrical) of Public Works Department (PWD). Since a lift contains a combination of mechanical, electrical equipment and of course with a bit if civil works, it is but natural that the Lift Inspectorate is brought under the authority of a Chief Engineer in the State’s PWD wing. What one must also realise is the fact that there are scores of lifts in Hyderabad and other urban centres in Telangana and even in Andhra Pradesh that are running without safeties, with poor quality equipment and no regular preventive maintenance. Such unsafe lifts have become veritable death traps.\\n\\nAccording to estimates, there are more than 250 lift suppliers in Telangana and most of them are operating out of Hyderabad. The sad part is that a majority of them are unqualified and less experienced to install and maintain the lifts. In such a scenario, a Lift Inspectorate and a Lift Act will ensure that only qualified technical personnel approved by them are allowed to install and maintain lifts. This measure alone will go a long way in drastically reducing the number of lift related accidents.\\n\\nThere is also an urgent need for the State government to launch a special drive that will take up inspection of safety standards of lifts in Hyderabad. However, even for that to happen, there are challenges like shortage of sector experts who can visit and conduct a proper scientific physical examination of safety aspects of lifts. In such circumstances, adopting a Lift Act and setting lift inspectorates under State Government’s Public Works Departments (PWD) appears to be an ideal way forwards.\\n\\n(The author is a sector expert and a consultant on elevators and escalators.

After serving the national carrier for decades he retired as Assistant Signal Inspector.\\n\\nPost retirement from his government job, Tilak joined Infotech Enterprises (a private IT firm) as a Design Engineering (Consultant). Tilak, who was drawing pension from his previous job, did not use the money for serving his personal needs and instead utilised the money for filling the potholes on the roads.\\n\\nWhen and how did he start filling potholes?\\n\\nTilak told OneIndia that it all started in 2010, when he was driving down a Hyderabad road and he saw a speeding car dirtying uniforms of some school-going kids as the potholed-roads were filled with rain water. The very next day, he saw an accident on the same road in which a young man lost both his limbs, in a RTC bus and auto collision. Police blamed negligent driving for the road accident.\\n\\nBut, being an eyewitness to the tragic event, Tilak was shaken to the core, for he knew the actual cause of the tragedy. He filled the potholed-road the very next day which gave him a lot of satisfaction. From that day on, Tilak continues to do this selfless service of treating the roads in the city wherever he finds such aberrations.\\n\\nTilak initially started filling potholes as a weekend ritual but in 2011 he quit his job at Infotech and took it up as a full time job.\\n\\nTilak\\'s job is a shame for civic bodies\\n\\nThis may be a matter of pride and satisfaction for Tilak, but he somewhere also reveals the callousness of the civic authorities, who despite having large infrastructure could not fill potholes.\\n\\nTilak said that whenever he comes across any potholes, the first thing he does is he informs the civic authorities. If the civic authorities repair the roads then well and good else he himself fills it on his own.\\n\\nIn the past 5 years, Tilak has filled more than a thousand potholes in Hyderabad city.\\n\\nIt costs him approximately Rs 5,000 to purchase raw materials for repairing the broken roads, which he shells out from his own pocket.\\n\\nFill potholes first, super specialty hospitals can wait\\n\\nWhen asked about his view on filling potholes first and constructing super specialty hospitals later, Tilak said if roads are good then hundreds of lives could be saved by avoiding accidents while government may or may not be able to save lives even after spending Rs 100-1000 crore need to construct hospitals.\\n\\nFamily never objected\\n\\nWhen asked if his family has ever objected to his spending all his money on this, Tilak says, \"My wife says when she never took salary while I was working then what is she going to do with my pension.\" Tilak further adds, \"My son is doing good in US and he always backs me in this.\"\\n\\nWants to directly talk to the politicians\\n\\nTilak has expressed his desire to talk to the politicians and bureaucrats one-to-one to ask them to put an end to widespread corruption in the system.\\n\\n\"If leaders decide they will be able to end corruption within days.

Owais appears to have not stopped even when Nabeel went limp for a few seconds before collapsing on the road. He is believed to have died instantly.\\n\\nNabeel’s friends told family he died in a bike accident. Nabeel’s friends told family he died in a bike accident.\\n\\nPolice will exhume Nabeel’s body on Monday for a second autopsy and are likely to convert the case from suspicious death to murder.\\n\\nA student of Falaknuma Presidency College, Nabeel was good in studies and loved maths, computer science and wrestling.\\n\\nAccording to police, while Owais ran away, the other six friends of Nabeel present called up his mother, indicated there had been a motorcycle accident, and took Nabeel to hospital where he was declared dead. Instead of waiting for his family at the hospital then, they took Nabeel’s body home and allegedly told his mother to stay away from police as Nabeel did not have a driving licence and was involved in an accident.\\n\\nThe suspicion that something was amiss arose when Nabeel’s father Dastagir Mohammed came from Saudi Arabia, where he works as a driver, and after his son’s burial, started questioning his friends about the incident. Their allegedly evasive replies and the discrepancies in their accounts made him suspicious and he lodged a complaint with Mir Chowk Police Station on May 7, seeking an investigation.\\n\\nApart from Owais, he named Nabeel’s friends Omar Baig, Abu Bakar, Shabaz alias Dollar, Salman, Sultan, and Irfan Pathan, saying they were hiding information from him.\\n\\n“We registered a case and started investigating. The youths had destroyed the memory cards in their mobile phones, on which they had taken videos of the fight. Some of them also changed the handsets. However, we got one video which shows what happened,” said investigating officer Sub-Inspector M Seetharamulu.\\n\\nAs per a statement given by one of the youths, say police, they all gathered in a lane near Indo-American School for a wrestling match at 6 am on May 3. “The fight was between Nabeel and Owais and the friends waged bets and took sides. They also gave advice to both of them on how to fight to win. There are many things that raise suspicion, like the timing of the match. In the video, one person is seen whispering in Owais’s ear just before the bout started. What did he tell him? Was it only for betting or were Nabeel and Owais involved in a feud and this was organised to settle it? We are investigating all this,” Seetharamulu said.\\n\\nDastagir Mohammed said he hoped his only son would become an engineer or do MBA. “Most of the members in our family are illiterate or semi-literate. Nabeel’s two elder sisters are married while one is unmarried. I was hoping Nabeel would become an engineer, get a decent job and help the family. Instead, I buried him. He was a good son, obedient and a good student,” the father said.\\n\\nHe added that he didn’t know Nabeel and his friends were into betting or wrestling. “His mother had cautioned him a couple of times not to hang out with these friends who caused his death, because she felt they were not good people,’’ Datagir said, lamenting that the friends whom Nabeel considered close had lied and misled them.\\n\\n“Until I lodged the police complaint, they were at my home, comforting and consoling us, and helping for the funeral. All this time, the boys who were responsible for my son’s death stayed closest to the family,” he lashed out.\\n\\nDemanding that the friends be jailed, Nabeel’s father said, “I don’t care if they had a wrestling match and my son died because of it. I want to see the youths who are responsible for this behind bars so that other boys learn not to get involved in such things.”', 'A video retrieved from the mobile phone of a friend has led police to believe that the death of a 17-year-old here a week ago was the result of a wrestling match.\\nThe friends who were present at the match allegedly hid this from the family, telling them Nabeel Mohammed died in a motorcycle accident.\\nNabeel’s friends told family he died in a bike accident.\\nNabeel’s friends told family he died in a bike accident.\\nDemanding that the friends be jailed, Nabeel’s father said, “I don’t care if they had a wrestling match and my son died because of it.']\n",

Her parents rushed her to Bhitai hospital in Latifabad but she succumbed to her wounds at around 11pm the same day. According to the duty doctor, the dogs ripped off her leg and a part of her skull.\"Several dogs were biting her when we reached there to save her,\" said her brother, Manzoor Chandio. \"We had lost hope that medical attention will save her life because the dogs had eaten her.\"According to Saira\\'s father, Mumtaz Chandio, the dogs have developed taste for human flesh and bones as they feed at a nearby cremation site. \"We [the residents] have requested the municipality to get rid of these dogs many times but they don\\'t listen to us,\" he complained.As many as 1,497 cases of dog bites were reported in dozens of taluka hospitals, basic health units, dispensaries and other health facilities in 2014, according to the statistics shared by assistant district health officer Dr Altaf Khehro. However, the figure does not include the district\\'s largest government hospital, which alone receives more cases than all the health facilities combined. The medical superintendent of the Civil Hospital, Dr Rafiqul Hassan Khokhar, sought time to share the statistics.A majority of the dog bite cases, 1,027, were reported in the health facilities in Hyderabad Rural taluka followed by 160 in Latifabad, 132 in City and 78 in Qasimabad talukas. However, most of the cases are referred to Civil hospital because anti-rabies vaccines are often not available in the BHUs, dispensaries and taluka hospitals.Apart from the children, the polio teams are also frequently attacked by dogs, admitted Dr Khehro. \"We receive between three to seven cases of dog bites on each day of the three-day polio campaign,\" he told. \"Time and again, we write to the deputy commissioner, the municipal commissioner and the TMAs to get rid of the stray dogs but we haven\\'t seen them taking serious action against this menace.\"According to Dr Khehro, the dogs become more violent during winter as a large number of cases surface during this season.A patient who has suffered from a dog bite is given five doses of vaccination over a period of one month. Each dose costs between Rs700 to Rs900 while the complete vaccination costs between Rs3,500 to Rs4,500.By this count, the health authorities, excluding Civil hospital, spent at least Rs5.2 million, if not more, on the anti-rabies vaccine in 2014. The amount is far higher in comparison to the expenses that municipalities may incur if they carry out regular campaigns to kill stray dogs.A kilogramme of poison called strychnine, enough to kill around a 1,000 dogs, costs Rs140,000. The deputy commissioner, Fayaz Hussain Jatoi, who convened a meeting of the municipal officials on Monday, said each of the four talukas in the district will be given a kilogramme of the poison for the next few months. Strychnine is only available in Lahore and, therefore, it will take a few days to get the consignment delivered.\"The financial health of the municipalities is in bad shape,\" said Jatoi. \"The state of affairs in Qasimabad [town municipal administration] is known to all so I have requested Rural taluka\\'s municipal administration to pay for the poison for Qasimabad.\" The dogs will be buried at a dumping site seven kilometres off Latifabad on Tando Muhammad Khan road.Meanwhile, other officials in the department are not impressed by the deputy commissioner\\'s claims. \"A few days from today, people will forget about the child\\'s death and the need to kill dogs,\" said a municipal official who requested anonymity.

The case drew even more attention than usual, as Chennai Police, in a first, arrested the mother for letting the minor boy ride without a driving license.\\n\\nChennai police seems to have followed suit of the Hyderabad police in this case, with reports of the latter having launched a massive crackdown against underage driving, are arresting the parents. Business Standard recently reported that police in the Telangana capital catch more than 30 minors behind the wheels every month. The fact that more than 130 minor riders were killed in accidents in Hyderabad last year and the police have collected Rs 7,23,900 in fine in 2016 alone, clearly shows the increasing trend of underage driving.\\n\\nOn the other hand, India’s capital, Delhi ranks first in the increasing minor drivers with the average age of all violators in 2014 being 14 years.\\n\\n“Curbing underage driving is a difficult task. A few years ago, Delhi police impounded the vehicles driven by minors and slashed a fine of Rs 1000 on the owners. But, there was no change. Since awareness is important, we visit schools in the neighbourhood and sensitise the audience on the complications of underage driving,” said Manoj Kumar Sharma, Station house officer, Mayur Vihar Police Station, Delhi.\\n\\nIs it a big deal, really?\\n\\nAccording to data from the Ministry of Road Transport and Highways, 10,622 persons under the age of 18 lost their lives to road crashes in India, accounting for 29 deaths on average every day. Among the 10,622 persons dead, 3,417 deaths were of those children/adolescents who were driving the vehicle.\\n\\n“According to official data, 18,738 of total road crashes in 2016 in India were committed by persons below the age of 18. Out of these, over 5,000 crashes were fatal in nature. Holding guardians accountable for underage driving is essential to change the callous attitude they have towards the issue,” said Piyush Tewari, Founder & CEO SaveLIFE Foundation, a non governmental organisation working on improving road safety in India.\\n\\nWhat the law says\\n\\nThough penalisation of vehicle owners in an accident case is neither alien nor new to the Indian Penal Code (IPC), its implementation is trend setting, as it raises hopes of a decline in the involvement and fatalities of minors in road accidents.\\n\\nSection 5 read with Section 180 of the Motor Vehicles Act allows the police to penalise vehicle owners for allowing unauthorised persons to drive. “Vehicle owners shall be punishable with imprisonment for a term which may extend to three months, or with fine extending to one thousand rupees or with both,” says Section 180 of the Motor Vehicles Act.\\n\\nNeed for a more rigid rule\\n\\nThe existing act is not strict enough to take a tough stand against underage driving. Police officials say that vehicle owners get away with it, after paying a fine. “A thousand-rupee fine does not reform the offender, who more often than not belongs to the upper middle class of society. There is a growing trend of repeat offenders in Chennai,” said a senior police official from Chennai.\\n\\nThe Motor Vehicles (Amendment) Bill, introduced in Lok Sabha in 2016 and passed in April 2017 has a provision for adult accountability for underage driving that has been initiated through Section 199A.\\n\\nExplaining the provision, Piyush Tewari said, “A guardian/owner of the vehicle can be imprisoned for up to 3 years and fined 25,000 rupees if a juvenile is found driving the vehicle. The section also allows for cancellation of the registration of the motor vehicle being used for such activity for 12 months; the juvenile shall not be issued a learner’s license till the age of 25 for such an offence.”\\n\\nHowever, the Bill remains pending in Rajya Sabha since the last winter session and needs to be passed in order to ensure nation wide implementation of this provision.\\n\\nThrill of taboo\\n\\nAccording to psychiatrists, adolescent children, and boys more often, indulge in bike racing and rash driving to impress peers. “They feel a sense of freedom by violating the law. It is that feel that prompts an underage driver to not wear helmets and seat belts. Most of them don’t follow traffic rules, a self destructive factor which also poses danger to other road users,” says Sudha R, noted psychiatrist from Bangalore.\\n\\nTeenage driving is also a risk because minors cannot make judgements and are bad at decision making, added Sudha.\\n\\nLearning from Delhi Police, Gurugram district administration is also conducting awareness sessions in schools, to sensitise students on the dangers of underage or teenage driving. But Delhi and Ranchi have a lot of stories to prove that education about safe practices at the school level only is not completely effective. Experts feel that parents, who are the vehicle owners, should be sensitised, and penalised in case of violations, for a better outcome.\\n\\nWelcoming the police’s initiative of punishing parents in Chennai and Hyderabad, Piyush Tewari said, “Parents have the sole and clear responsibility to ensure that their underage children don’t get behind the wheels of a motor vehicle. A vehicle in the hands of an untrained person is a weapon, capable of inflicting serious harm. The pending bill in the Rajya Sabha needs to be passed at the soonest to see that such provisions come to fruition.”', '“Curbing underage driving is a difficult task.\\nSection 5 read with Section 180 of the Motor Vehicles Act allows the police to penalise vehicle owners for allowing unauthorised persons to drive.\\nNeed for a more rigid ruleThe existing act is not strict enough to take a tough stand against underage driving.\\nPolice officials say that vehicle owners get away with it, after paying a fine.\\nExperts feel that parents, who are the vehicle owners, should be sensitised, and penalised in case of violations, for a better outcome.']\n",

All metro stations in the city double up as FOBs, and are accessible to all pedestrians.\\n\\n“One can catch a bus to anywhere in the north-west, east or south Hyderabad from the place. This is probably the biggest bus route road that is not a bus terminal. About a 100 buses pass through this triangular one-way route every hour,” says GSR Chaitanya, a transport researcher, who, as part of his research, walked along the triangular one-way route. He recently presented his observations in a presentation to a crowd at Do Din 2018, an event organised by the Hyderabad Urban Labs.\\n\\nChaitanya observed that ever since the Hyderabad Metro was built, the bus bays that allowed the smooth flow of traffic along this route were made smaller.\\n\\n”This is because the stairways for the metro have taken up space that used to be part of the bus bays. This has had a cascading impact,” says Chaitanya, as there is less space for commuters on the footpath. The railings, which have been placed to demarcate the bus bay, forces people to stand on the road. Due to this, buses have begun halting on the main road. This makes Lakdi-ka-pul a traffic choke point “because the metro stairs and footpaths and bus stands were not designed well,” he says.\\n\\nCommuters also have to struggle to use the bus stop, as they have to cross the road. There are no visible zebra or grade crossings to access the three major bus stops in the locality, and a pedestrian has no choice but to count their luck and cross the dangerous highway.\\n\\nPedestrians account for the highest road accident victims in city, with the Hyderabad traffic police having recorded 430 accidents involving pedestrians in the city up until June 30. Nearly 50% of the accidents in the city involve pedestrians.\\n\\nChaitanya points out that when seen from above, Lakdi-ka-pul is triangular. “The three roads that form the triangle are all one-way. These one-way roads serve traffic coming from South and Eastern parts of the city and moving towards north-west Hyderabad, using the new and old Bombay highway,” he says. There are three bus stops on each of these one-way roads, and none of them are easy for commuters to access unless they are able-bodied, Chaitanya found.\\n\\nChaitanya walked around the triangle to figure out how hard it is to access these places. The main intersection does not have any signal to regulate traffic and pedestrians have to struggle to even reach the metro staircase.\\n\\n“The new bus shelters also end up blocking the footpath. We need to design a road with all of its elements. Bus shelters, pedestrian crossings and consider them all to be part of the street furniture.”\\n\\nWith this being the condition of Lakdi-ka-pul, the rest of Hyderabad isn’t pedestrian friendly either.\\n\\n“In Indian cities, a third of the population walks. Even if people are using the bus or auto, people still need space for walking. It's not just Hyderabad, there are no cities in the country that are pedestrian friendly,” says Girish Agarwal, a professor at Jindal School of Art and Architecture\\n\\nHe points out that the construction and design of footpaths and pedestrian crossings are derived from the state’s transport policy, but are not followed as there is no systematic requirement for departments involved to interact.\\n\\n“The copy paste design for metros, lifted from European countries, is not suited for building metro stations in India. There is a need for more stakeholder involvement. On paper, they hold public meetings, but no one really knows when or where it happens. I was involved with a transport project in California, the US, we spent two years consulting with the people who will be using it before groundwork started for the project. Here we decide where the station will come up and then look for comments from the public,” he adds.\\n\\nRead: Meet the Hyderabad man measuring footpaths to throw spotlight on road safety\", 'Is Lakdi-ka-pul, one of Hyderabad’s busiest areas, pedestrian-friendly?\\nLakdi-ka-pul is served by buses, the metro and the MMTS, but is still a traffic nightmare.\\nTake Lakdi-ka-pul in Hyderabad for instance.\\nThe fact that the city may not be pedestrian-friendly is a sentiment that is being echoed by transport researchers as well.\\nThis makes Lakdi-ka-pul a traffic choke point “because the metro stairs and footpaths and bus stands were not designed well,” he says.']\n",

(Photo:P. SURENDRA)\\n\\nHyderabad: Overcrowding in state-run Road Transport Corporation (RTC) buses and privately run buses continues despite the major accident at the Kondagattu ghat that claimed 63 lives last month. The Road Transport Corporation and the Road Transport Authority (RTA) are blaming each other for not controlling the problem. While the RTC does not provide sufficient number of buses in areas where demand is high, and the RTA has failed to regularly inspect overcrowding in buses, the issue continues to haunt passengers.\\n\\nThis correspondent has observed that many buses at the Secunderabad railway station do not move on after all the seats are taken and wait for standing space to be filled to overflowing. Moreover, the conductor stops the bus for more people to board along the way. Riding on the footboard is also allowed during peak college and office hours.\\n\\nIn case of an accident, standing passengers will be the worst affected. There have even been instances of passengers dying from suffocation in overcrowded buses.\\n\\nThe usual passenger capacity is around 50 to 60, but is being extended to 115 to 120.\\n\\n“Overcrowding is not only dangerous at the time of crashes, but it also affects the technical aspects of the bus, like braking, steering and gear function. It worsens the condition of our ageing buses,” says road safety expert Vinod Kumar Kanumala, chief functionary of the Indian Federation of Road Safety.\\n\\nAccording to Mr Kanumala, it is the responsibility of the RTA to check violations by vehicles, and the RTC is not ensuring that the RTA does its work.\\n\\nPublic transport usually runs at a loss in most countries the world over because the purpose is to serve the public and not to make profits. This does not mean that the RTC can compromise on safety.\\n\\nTransport department officers say that lack of staff is one of the reasons they don\\'t conduct checks. C. Ramesh, Joint Transport Commissioner, says: “Due to the lack of staff, our existing inspectors are getting burdened with office work, which is affecting their checking.”\\n\\nAccording to the Transport department, 151 cases have been booked against bus drivers whose buses were overcrowded between April and September this year, for which the RTA has not received the amount.\\n\\nHighly placed sources in the transport department allege that their department is under pressure not to book RTC buses because of the poor financial condition of the corporation. Moreover, the fine for overcrowding is just `100. As such, the emphasis is more on tax evasion violations, in order to meet revenue targets, as these run into lakhs of rupees in fines. In other words, making money is more important than the safety and lives of passengers.\\n\\nDrivers and conductors say they are the scapegoats, as they are forced to meet targets. N. Krishna, a driver of the Hakimpet depot, and president of the Telangana Jathiya Mazdoor Union (TJMU) explains, “overcrowding is a problem for the staff as well because the conductor won\\'t be able to collect money for tickets from all passengers and check bus passes too. But, we cannot deny service to people when there is no other alternative for them as happens mostly in villages.”\\n\\nDrivers and conductors also have to meet targets like occupancy ratio and kilometre/per litre targets, else they are subjected to counselling and the humiliating sight of their names displayed on target boards outside the depots.\\n\\nThe RTC administration has a different take on the subject. Executive director M Ravinder says, \"The problem of overcrowding occurs only at peak hours in the mornings and evenings for a couple of hours. If we take maximum capacity of people as an average in an area, and run buses accordingly, then it would be a loss to the organisation because then buses will have to ply vacant.

His car somersaulted thrice on the road, but he miraculously escaped the accident without a scratch. For the then 19-year-old Jasper, it was a moment of realisation. He counted his blessings after his close brush with death, and became determined to do something more meaningful with life.\\n\\nFour years later, Jasper, a BTech graduate, runs four shelter homes for the destitute in the city, housing over 120 people, with 12 staffers working with him. He is the founder of the Second Chance NGO, that rescues the destitute from the streets who are on the brink of death. During the course of his work, 23-year-old Jasper has seen several deaths. “Many of them have died in my arms, and for many, I have conducted their last rites too,” Jasper says.\\n\\nIt all began two months after his near-death experience in 2014, when he saw an old sick woman abandoned on the street, says Jasper. “I was travelling through Secunderabad when I noticed an old, fragile lady lying motionless near the Secunderabad railway station. I saw her and left, but later that day realised that I saw her for a reason. I came back to the spot and on closer examination saw that she had serious injuries. She had maggots crawling out of her injuries and ants all over her body. I just couldn’t let her stay and I took her and admitted her at the Gandhi Hospital,” Jasper recounts.\\n\\nAfter the incident, the young man made a video of the woman that quickly caught pace on social media. “A lot of people started sharing the video and it soon went viral. After a few days, we got a call from the woman’s relatives after they saw the video on Facebook. They came down to Hyderabad and took her home. And at that moment, I realised I didn’t want to anything but this for the rest of my life,” Jasper says.\\n\\nAfter working with several NGOs across the city, Jasper set up his own shelter home, ‘Second Chance’, in March 2017. Jasper has around 12 staff working with him, including a nurse and other trained non-clinical staff.\\n\\n“Our services are coordinated with the city police. It’s mostly the cops who give us a call whenever they spot a sick person on the street. We then go to the location, check their vitals, and bring them to our home. If the person needs serious medical help, we admit them at the nearest hospital. Doctors and paramedics visit our home on a regular basis for free,” Jasper says.\\n\\nJasper says that he gets a lot of calls from strangers as well to rescue people, and this means he has to first authenticate the case before his team swings into action. “We sometimes get calls from people to rescue their own family members but we don’t encourage it. We rescue men above 20 years of age and women over 50 (because he doesn’t have the licence to take in younger women). As of now, I have rescued over 600 people and my four homes put together have over 120 people,” Jasper says.\\n\\nA lot of people contact Jasper in search of their missing relatives, and many of them have been happily reunited with their families. Jasper recalls an incident where an elderly woman was reunited with her family, in what he describes was a mere stroke of luck.\\n\\n“Second Chance was getting featured in a magazine and for the cover picture, I was clicked sitting alongside an elderly woman from our shelter home. After the story got published, I got a call from a woman enquiring about the lady in the photograph. It turned out that she was her mother and her family was frantically searching for her for a couple of months,” Jasper recalls.\\n\\nThe NGO also maintains a record of the details and photographs of the rescued people in the nearest police stations. “Our NGO has been maintaining a complete database with the city police bureau of the people rescued. This has helped a lot of people who approach cops with missing complaints to easily identify their kin,” Jasper says.\\n\\nAs for their funding, a major chunk of the money comes through the good Samaritans on social media. Even though it was hard for the team to raise money initially, many people started supporting seeing the good work.\\n\\n“Not including the salary, the monthly expenses of our inmates come close to three lakh rupees. Needless to mention the building rents. The owner of one of our shelter homes at Sainikpuri has now asked us to vacate and finding a space has become a real issue. I have even tweeted tagging government officials for a piece of land or place to run the NGO, but to no avail,” Jasper says.\\n\\nJasper says that he is determined to do something different. “If I can continue to transform the lives of even a handful of people for the better, that is what I will continue to do,” Jasper adds.', 'Meet Jasper, Hyderabadi man who was inspired to rescue the destitute after an accidentHe started rescuing people who are on the brink of death after his close shave with death four years ago.\\nnews Human interestIt was in 2014 that Jasper Paul, then an engineering student, met with an almost fatal accident in Hyderabad.\\nFour years later, Jasper, a BTech graduate, runs four shelter homes for the destitute in the city, housing over 120 people, with 12 staffers working with him.\\n“Many of them have died in my arms, and for many, I have conducted their last rites too,” Jasper says.\\nAfter working with several NGOs across the city, Jasper set up his own shelter home, ‘Second Chance’, in March 2017.']\n",

However, one particularly disturbing trend that has emerged lately is that of clicking dangerous selfies; proving to be so disastrous that during the year 2015 alone, there have been more deaths caused due to selfies than shark attacks all over the world .

A lot of them have a helmet on but not all. A few recent incidents of schoolchildren dying in road accidents on way to school or back home riding pillion with their parents have spurred the city police to look into safety aspects of the issue. In at least one accident case the woman riding a two-wheeler had not worn a helmet leading to serious injuries to her, besides of course the child dying from the fall.\\n\\nThe Hyderabad traffic police are now tightening its belt on the helmet rule for all riders, especially parents travelling with school kids. Among two young school girls who lost their lives in road mishaps last week, one sustained a cracked skull while other one’s head got crushed under the wheel of a bus. Road safety experts note that the pillion rider is at a greater risk of suffering serious head injuries in an accident.\\n\\nTraffic police DCP says parents should ensure that the kids are safe in the pillion seat and have something to hold on to in case of sudden braking. Helmet dealers in the city say that hardly anyone comes to them asking for a helmet for children, leaving them to not keeping a stock of the item any more.\\n\\nWhile the city traffic police are enforcing the helmet rule on riders and pillion riders, children riding pillion are at a significantly higher risk. Indian Federation of Road Safety chief functionary M. Vinod Kanumula says, “Wearing helmets is mandatory in all states, but the government has never focussed on safety issues relating to children.”\\n\\n“Children come back from school with heavy school bags after a tiring day. While riding back home they are vulnerable to lose balance in case of sudden braking. There are chances that the child may slip and fall as there is little to hold on to. Also, after an exhausting day at school, often a child dozes off midway on the way home, making it very dangerous for him/her,” says Chandra Shekar, a father of a child.\\n\\n“There are child motorcycle helmets in the market, although all accessories stores do not stocking these. Even if kids’ helmets are not available easily, a responsible parent would head out and get it from wherever it is sold. Online stores are another place where a kid’s helmet can be bought. There is no room for excuses,” said Mr. Kanumula.\\n\\n“Safety of the pillion rider is as much at risk as the rider. I can tell you from years of experience that there is no fear in the public about traffic safety laws and rules. The fear of getting caught and penalised must be instilled,” says Dr. Kamal Soi, member of National Road Safety Council of the ministry of road transport and highway. “Rules are strict on paper but authorities concerned need to work harder to enforce them,” he added.\\n\\nA helmet dealer in Abids, Mohd Salim, says, “There is no demand for children helmets. At the most just one is sold in a month. As a result, we do not keep helmets at the store and get it only if somebody wants it.”\\n\\nThere are of course a few who follow the helmet rule -- not out of fear of a penalty but in the general safety interests of the family. Debu Sinha, a resident of Abids, says, “I make sure my children wear their helmets when they ride pillion with me. It may be a small trip just round the corner of the street, but one cannot foretell accidents and the risk is there all the time. Helmets save lives, which should be easy to understand.”', 'The Hyderabad traffic police are now tightening its belt on the helmet rule for all riders, especially parents travelling with school kids.\\nRoad safety experts note that the pillion rider is at a greater risk of suffering serious head injuries in an accident.\\nWhile the city traffic police are enforcing the helmet rule on riders and pillion riders, children riding pillion are at a significantly higher risk.\\nEven if kids’ helmets are not available easily, a responsible parent would head out and get it from wherever it is sold.\\nOnline stores are another place where a kid’s helmet can be bought.']\n",

Ditto the number of deaths which stood at 49 at the end of 2015. It has already touched 44 (upto November), this year. In November alone, four deaths occurred on ORR. The latest in a long string of mishaps being the case of a techie who was killed after an unknown vehicle rammed his bike near Rajendranagar. Interestingly, the victim managed to enter ORR despite the two-wheeler ban imposed on this road stretch.“Due to the relaxation on toll collection, the toll booth at the entrance of ORR was unmanned when the incident occurred. This is probably how the two-wheeler got in,” said A R Srinivas, deputy commissioner of police (traffic), Cyberabad.While the ORR patrolling scheme, which was initiated in 2014, had engaged five patrolling vehicles between Peddamberpet and Shamirpet via Shamshabad, only two patrolling vehicles currently operate on the ORR stretch, said traffic cops. Road safety experts point to an increased number of traffic rule violations, owing to the lack of enforcement along this stretch.“Lane violation is a rampant practise on Outer Ring Road due to lack of frequent checks. In addition to introducing more patrolling vehicles on this route, the traffic police must notify commuters when they’re approaching an accident prone zone using road signs. The ORR also has too many exits which are often used as entry points by violators. This must be checked,” said Dheerendra Samineni, founder of India Safedrive, an NGO working in the area of road safety.In the last enforcement drive conducted by the Cyberabad traffic police from January to September this year, a total of 604 cases were booked out of which a whopping 554 cases were booked for ‘lane violations, driving on wrong side, entry from wrong side and dangerous driving.“There are no traffic cops on duty on the ORR after 10:30 pm. Only two patrolling teams do the manning, one posted in the ORR-Nanakramguda stretch and the other on the Nanakramguda-Shamshabad stretch, in the late-night hours. This is perhaps why it has become easy for people to hoodwink traffic cops,” said Srinivas.Nov 27, 2016: A techie suffered serious injuries and died on the spot near Exit 17 of ORR.

She has to cross the most dreaded road in Greater Hyderabad limits which causes her considerable discomfort.\\n\\n“I am afraid to cross the road,” says Swetha Sharma of Vanasthalipuram who has to cross the Nagarjunasagar Highway every day to board her bus for work at Ramoji film city.\\n\\n“The road has no pedestrian crossings nor does this area have any footpaths. That is a highway running through a residential area, at least there should be a zebra crossing at the signals, they dont even have that,” she complained.\\n\\nThis is not the problem of Swetha Sharma alone. Pedestrians are sitting ducks on Hyderabad roads and elderly and children are the most vulnerable. Most Hyderabad roads dont have Zebra crossings or pedestrian crossings. The elderly and children have to depend on a police constables or some good Samaritan to help them cross the road.\\n\\nStatistics prove that their fear is not unfounded. The road accident data of the Cyberabad traffic police puts pedestrian deaths at the top of the list with 276 pedestrians dying this year alone.\\n\\nVanasthalipuram on Swetha’s daily commute saw 48 pedestrian deaths this year the area , the highest of any area of the city so far this year.\\n\\nThe responsibility for maintaining pedestrian crossings in the city lies with the GHMC. In April 2011, the GHMC had planned to create a special cell to deal with pedestrian problems comprising of its own officials, NGOs that work on road safety and other experts. However, that initiative failed to see the light of the day. The Lokayukta too had asked GHMC to create pedestrian committees, which also hasn’t been constituted.\\n\\n“The GHMC was supposed to take the initiative but they didn’t. They wanted pedestrian committees set up at all the 150-odd wards and eventually nothing happened,” said Kanthimani Kannan, founder of the Right to Walk Foundation. Again in September 2011, the GHMC had planned a “pilot programme” with model footpaths in five roads with a total length of 100 km. “They tried their best and put up bollards but someone removed the bollards,” Kanthimani added.\\n\\nMost of the GHMC officials working to the issue, claimed ignorance about the directives for the pedestrian committee. “All that maybe happened before bifurcation. Some of us are new and are unaware of what had happened then,” a GHMC official said.\\n\\n\\n\\nNo to Foot over Bridges\\n\\nDo foot over bridges (FoBs) solve the problem? No say many. The GHMC recently called for tenders to construct 53 foot over bridges across the city but at the same time a few of the existing foot over bridges have been removed citing construction of the metro, further adding to citizens woes.\\n\\n“Not all foot over bridges were removed, only a few due to hyderabad metro rail construction. We have ensured there are foot over bridges even in the outer rung of the city,” said Suresh, chief engineer, GHMC. All the foot over bridges will be constructed under Public Private Partnership (PPP) model, he added. In 2008, the GHMC had floated tenders based on PPP and Build Operate and Transfer (BOT) models for constructing foot over bridges in the city but after not finding any takers and with companies dropping the project, GHMC had mulled dropping the PPP model in 2012.\\n\\n“I don’t use the FOB. Who is going to climb all those stairs? I just cross the road,” said Shukoor Rehman, a class 11 student. “I dont know why people don’t realise foot over bridges are a ridiculous concept,” said Kanthimani. Can senior citizens use these foot over bridges? Half the time the elevators and lifts don’t work. It will be a nightmare for the senior citizens,” he added. Kanthimani insisted that people need pedestrian crossings on the road.', 'She has to cross the most dreaded road in Greater Hyderabad limits which causes her considerable discomfort.\\n“The road has no pedestrian crossings nor does this area have any footpaths.\\nMost Hyderabad roads dont have Zebra crossings or pedestrian crossings.\\nThe responsibility for maintaining pedestrian crossings in the city lies with the GHMC.\\nKanthimani insisted that people need pedestrian crossings on the road.']\n",
